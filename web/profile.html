				<!-- About Me -->
				<h3>A quick one-liner about yourself!</h3>
				<p>
					In this section of the page, a short biography or
					introduction about the user would be displayed. Each user
					writes his own biography. Only friends of the user are
					allowed to see them. The single line above this that acts as
					a header for their page is visible to everyone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Privacy is very important for the Den. This is why every
					user is referenced by their self-assigned usernames. If a
					user would like to have his real name displayed on the
					profile page, it can be added to his personal information
					and placed in the table on the side of his profile.
				</p>
				<p>
					User images are <strong>not</strong> live on the internet.
					They can only be accessed through a script which checks for
					the user's login session cookie and verifies that the
					logged-in user has permission to see that user's picture.
					This is a sharp contrast from Facebook, where the direct
					link to any image can be shared and accessed by anyone, even
					those who would normally not have permission to see it.
				</p>
				<p>
					This security also saves network resources, because images
					cannot be hotlinked on other websites.
